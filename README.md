Deep Sparse autoencoder for human activity identification using smartphone sensor data
Deep Sparse autoencoder for human activity identification using smartphone sensor data The confusion matrix was used to compute the performance matrix using the modified code of http://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-confusion-matrix-terminology/. Er.Abbas Manthiri S. The dataset was processed, segmented and magnitude, rotation angle was computed. The datasets used Shoaib et al(2016) http://ps.ewi.utwente.nl/Datasets.ph , DALIAC (https://www.mad.tf.fau.de/research/activitynet/daliac-daily-life-activities/) and Mhealth (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mhealth+dataset). ome part of the code are from Banos et al, 2017 through connected health summer school.
